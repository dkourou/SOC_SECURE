## Training Rhythm

You will operate on **three concurrent cycles**:

### Weekly Cycle

- Detection tuning
    
- Threat hunting
    
- Mini red team tests
    
- Alert review
    

### Monthly Campaign

- One structured adversary scenario
    
- Detection validation
    
- Incident response exercise
    

### Quarterly Exercises

- Full attack chain simulation
    
- SOC stress test
    
- Post‑incident engineering sprint

# How to Run This as a Realistic SOC Simulation

Daily:

- Run SOC shift workflow
    
- Perform one hunt
    
- Investigate 1–2 alerts
    

Weekly:

- run one red team attack
    
- evaluate detections
    
- update rules
    

Monthly:

- full purple team campaign
    
- produce SOC report
    
- update detection coverage
