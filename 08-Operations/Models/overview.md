## 1) SOC Mission (Lab Version)

Your SOC lab simulates a **mid-size enterprise security operations center** responsible for:

- Network monitoring (pfSense + Suricata)
    
- Endpoint detection (Wazuh agents + Sysmon)
    
- Identity monitoring (AD events)
    
- Incident detection & response
    
- Detection engineering
    
- Threat hunting
    
- Purple team validation
    

You will operate **three internal functions**:

|Function|Role|
|---|---|
|Monitoring|SOC Analysts|
|Engineering|Detection Engineer|
|Adversary Simulation|Red Team|

# 2) Metrics You Must Track Throughout the Year

- Mean Time to Detect
    
- Mean Time to Respond
    
- Alerts per attack
    
- False positive %
    
- Detection coverage by MITRE tactic
    
- % attacks detected before lateral movement

# 3) Annual SOC Deliverables (What You Should Produce)

- Detection rule library
    
- Incident response playbooks
    
- MITRE coverage matrix
    
- SOC performance report
    
- Threat hunting reports
    
- Purple team after-action reviews

# 4) What This Yearly Program Achieves

By month 12 your lab will simulate:

- Enterprise SOC monitoring
    
- Detection engineering lifecycle
    
- Identity attack defense
    
- Network IDS operations
    
- Incident response workflows
    
- Purple team continuous improvement
    

This is **very close to how real internal SOC maturity programs are structured**.
